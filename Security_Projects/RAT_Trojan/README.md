# To run:

This is the code of the post: https://mregraoncyber.com/?p=2157

To get the server.exe, you need to install PyInstaller and run:

    pyinstaller server.py

This will generate everything and allow you to run the script.cmd.

If you just want to test on a local machine and do not need to generate the .exe, you can simply run on one terminal:

    python3 server.py
  
And on another terminal:

    python3 client.py
